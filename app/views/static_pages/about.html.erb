<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>
  At the time of editing these pages, I am a student of Rails, 
  for about 6 weeks now and quite fascinated with the ease and solidity, 
  with which quite solid web applications can be developed by people, 
  who are, like me, not professional web designers. this "sample app"
  is now being implemented by me on my second tour through the second 
  edition of the original tutorial by Michael Hartl. 
</p><p>
  what I find especially fascination on this "Tour" through the tutorial is
  Twitter Bootstrap design code that is being integrated into the app, in combination
  with the new sass and coffescript gems that are part of the rails 3.2.2 version,
  that this app will be using. altogether, this will make the "sample app"
  even more usable and adaptable as a core for different future web apps,
  that I am indending to develop "on the side" </p>
  <p> I am also blogging a little about this development on my <a href="http://socialblogs.heroku.com/blogs/4">"first round" sample app</a>
  that I had already expanded with a simple blogging feature (so far without a comment function though). I intend to share different insights, problems and solutions on this blog, as I go along with this development. </p> 

<p>
  The <a href="http://railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a>
  is a project to make a book and screencasts to teach web development
  with <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>. This
  is the sample application for the tutorial.
